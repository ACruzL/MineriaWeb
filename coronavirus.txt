The coronavirus has now infected more than 1,000 people in the U.S., across 40 states.

"I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now," says the country's top authority on infectious diseases.

A relative in China messaged me concerned about the spread of the coronavirus in the US and urged me that if I feel sick to go get free testing &amp; treatment like how ppl did in China. I had to break it to him that the US does not give out free healthcare under any circumstance lol

“Oh you don’t have to worry about #coronavirus  if you’re young and fit” Well maybe if you’re young and fit you should be more concerned about not SPREADING IT TO SOMEONE WHO ISN’T. People are so selfish and that flippant attitude is dangerous.

I believe we can still mitigate the #coronavirus spread in the United States. But to do so we need sufficient testing to identify &amp; contain the virus. Right now we don’t have that &amp; time is running out.

Below is the warning from Dr. Fauci of the @realDonaldTrump Administration.

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen "here". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring, while there's little to be reassured of. #COVID19 #coronavirus

Officials told her she wasn’t allowed to test.

She did it anyway and found a bunch of cases.

So what happened? They told her to stop.
